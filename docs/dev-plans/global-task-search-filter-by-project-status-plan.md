Global Task Search — Filter by Project Status (ACTIVE | ARCHIVED)

References
- Backend ticket: `docs/backend-tickets/global-task-search-filter-by-projects.md`
- Project status enum: `src/projects/entities/project.entity.ts` (`ProjectStatus`)
- Global tasks endpoints: `src/tasks/controllers/global-tasks.controller.ts`
- Global search DTOs: `src/tasks/dto/global-search-tasks.dto.ts`, `src/tasks/dto/global-search-tasks-response.dto.ts`
- Tasks service logic: `src/tasks/tasks.service.ts`

Summary & Scope
- Add an optional filter to global tasks search to constrain by project status.
- Default behavior: include ONLY `ACTIVE` projects; users can explicitly include `ARCHIVED`.
- Apply to both:
  - `GET /tasks` ("my tasks" across projects)
  - `GET /tasks/search` (advanced global search)
- Non-goals: changing per-project endpoint semantics under `projects/:projectId/tasks`; only global endpoints are in-scope.

Assumptions & Constraints
- `ProjectStatus` enum is authoritative: `ACTIVE`, `ARCHIVED`.
- Access control remains enforced via existing project membership checks.
- Backward-compat: omitting the new filter must keep existing results (ACTIVE-only) to avoid noisy regressions.
- Pagination, sorting, and other filters must continue to work identically.

Open Questions (Blocking)
- [x] Param shape: prefer `projectStatus=ACTIVE|ARCHIVED` or `includeArchived=true`? Owner: BE — Decision: use `includeArchived?: boolean` (default false)
- [x] If `projectStatus=ARCHIVED`, do we exclude ACTIVE or allow multi-select? Owner: PM — N/A due to decision above
- [x] Should archived projects appear by default in internal (admin) contexts? Owner: PM — No

Incremental Plan

Phase 0 — Foundations
- [x] Confirm filter shape and defaults with PM (see Open Questions)
- [x] Update API docs annotations on controller methods to advertise the new param

Phase 1 — DTOs & Types
- [x] Add `includeArchived?: boolean` to `GlobalSearchTasksDto` with Swagger docs (default false)
- [x] Ensure legacy `projectId` rejection remains intact

- Phase 2 — Service Query Logic
- [x] Join `project` in global queries (already joined) and add `project.status` predicate
  - Default: `project.status = ACTIVE`
  - If `includeArchived=true`: remove predicate to include both ACTIVE and ARCHIVED
- [x] Ensure filter is applied in both `findAllUserTasks` (via `searchAllUserTasks`) and `searchAllUserTasks`

Phase 3 — Controllers & API Contract
- [x] `GET /tasks` add `@ApiQuery` for the new param
- [x] `GET /tasks/search` add `@ApiQuery` for the new param
- [x] Validate legacy `projectId` behavior remains unchanged (still 400)

Phase 4 — Tests
- [x] Unit: DTO validation scenarios, service filter application, default behavior
- [x] Integration: seed mixed ACTIVE/ARCHIVED projects and verify counts for:
  - default (ACTIVE only)
  - `projectStatus=ARCHIVED`
  - `includeArchived=true` (if chosen)
- [x] Contract tests: Swagger snapshot updated as needed

API/Schema & Types Impact
- DTO: `GlobalSearchTasksDto` gains `projectStatus?: ProjectStatus` (or `includeArchived?: boolean`)
- No DB schema changes.
- Ensure enums are imported from `projects/entities/project.entity.ts` to maintain a single source of truth.

UX Acceptance Criteria & Test Plan
- Given a user with tasks in both active and archived projects
  - When calling `GET /tasks` with no new param, then results contain only tasks in ACTIVE projects
  - When calling `GET /tasks?projectStatus=ARCHIVED`, then results contain only tasks in ARCHIVED projects
  - When calling `GET /tasks/search?projectStatus=ACTIVE`, behavior matches default
  - When calling the advanced search with mixed filters, the project status filter is respected alongside others

Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Silent change in defaults could surprise users
  - Mitigation: Keep default to ACTIVE (status quo), document change in Swagger and changelog
- Risk: Confusion between `projectStatus` vs future multi-status filters
  - Mitigation: Keep param narrowly scoped; consider `includeArchived` if simplicity is preferred

Rollout & Feature Flags
- No runtime flag needed; low-risk default-preserving evolution
- Announce in release notes; confirm API docs updates

Definition of Done
- [x] Swagger shows the new filter on both global endpoints
- [x] Default behavior returns only ACTIVE projects’ tasks
- [x] Tests: unit + integration updated and passing
- [x] Changelog entry committed
